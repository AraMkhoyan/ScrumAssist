        <h3 class="w3-center"> Information about Factors </h3>
        <p class="w3-center"><em> By treating timeboxes for Scrum events independently and based on the research, we created 10 factors that should be considered while deciding how each Scrum Event should be modified. The factors are purely based on research findings and are used to determine if the Scrum event should be removed, modified, or kept the same way. The same factor may be used while making a decision about multiple Scrum Events, and are all factors are mostly based on team’s and project’s characteristics.
            </em></p>

        <ul class="w3-content">
            <li>Team’s size
                <ul>
                    <li>Depending on the size of the team some of the Scrum Events might be required to last longer or shorter to accomplish their goal. For example, for larger teams Daily Scrum might be more effective if the team splits into 2 subteams, or for smaller teams the Retrospective meetings might be shorter as there are not a lot of people to raise their concerns and opinions. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Team’s performance
                <ul>
                    <li>Team’s performance is an important indicator for understanding what events might be a waste of time and which ones would be essential to complete. For instance, the length of the Sprint might be increased or decreased based on if the team is overperforming or underperforming.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Level of collaboration
                <ul>
                    <li>Scrum is a framework that highly encourages collaboration between developers, and understanding how well the team collaborates would factor out how some events are conducted or not. For example, high-performing and highly collaborative teams might skip Daily Scrums, as the whole idea of the event is to open space for collaboration, which becomes unnecessary if it is naturally being done.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Habits
                <ul>
                    <li>Habits factor tries to understand the everyday behaviours of team members and ensures that they are taken into account while conducting events. For example, if team members and Product Owner are usually being late from meetings, then the Sprint Review loses its advantage and might be a waste of time for both sides.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Swarming
                <ul>
                    <li>“Swarming” term refers to how well the team is organizing and keeping track of their tasks throughout the sprint and project length. The factor helps to understand how User Stories are being written, how often they are being discussed or updated, and what is the general behaviour around organizing Grooming meetings, where tasks are being estimated on their complexity. The factor plates a big role in deciding if some of the events like Spring Planning should be cut short or kept longer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Timebox for each event
                <ul>
                    <li>As we mentioned above, our correlation analysis showed that timeboxes for each event should not be influenced or affected by other Scrum Events. However, this factor is about understanding a team's past behaviour with a given event, and is being used only for recommendations for the same type of event. For example, if the timebox for the Spring is 3 weeks and combined with other factors it has been effective, it would be worth keeping it the same way. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Uncertainty and Risk assessment
                <ul>
                    <li>Many times teams face a lot of uncertainty and risks, and depending on that their tasks get blocked or performance decreases. Therefore, through this factor, we determine how Scrum events should be adjusted to account for any uncertainties and risks and avoid delays. For example, a team that faces many uncertainties and risks might need to shorten their Sprint durations so that they have an easier way to switch between tasks, do more planning, and not be blocked for a long time if a ticket has been carried to the sprint. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Overall project length
                <ul>
                    <li>Sometimes the projects last from a day to years, and it is crucial to understand the overall length of the project before deciding on the length of the spring, retrospectives, etc. For shorter Sprints, the Scrum events might be shorter also to have more iterations (Sprints) and achieve better results, while for longer projects, following more traditional Scrum might be a better option.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Process for getting feedback
                <ul>
                    <li>The process for getting feedback is an essential part of Scrum and its usage, as many other factors such as the team's performance would depend on it. For example, if the feedback is being received on a regular basis through 1:1 meetings, then Sprint Review meetings might lose their purpose.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Team’s preparation for each event
                <ul>
                    <li>Many Scrum events heavily depend on how well prepared the team is and how well they contribute to the discussion. Therefore, alongside understanding the Habits of the team, it is important to factor out how prepared they come to meetings. For example, Retrospective meetings or Sprint Reviews would not be effective if team members are not committed and are unprepared to those events. Also, Sprint Plannings would need to last longer if no preparation happened (through Swarming) beforehand. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
