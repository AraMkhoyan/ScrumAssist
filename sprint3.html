        <h3 class="w3-center"> Recommendations </h3>
        <p class="w3-center"><em> We recommend that you have 3-week or 4-week Sprints due to your project length, uncertainties and risks that you face, and team’s productivity. Here are more details on how to use Sprint Planning for your team. </em></p>

        <ul class="w3-content">
            <li>According to scrum guidelines, a sprint shouldn’t last more than four weeks, and its ideal length would be two weeks.</li>
            
            <li>Here are Pros of having long Sprints that may be useful to consider (Mark Levison)
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s easier to start practicing Scrum with longer Sprints because Teams often assume it will be easier to deliver a valuable chunk of work and get it to “Done” in one month rather than two weeks.
</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Here are Cons of having long Sprints that may be useful to consider (Mark Levison)
                <ul>
                    <li>It is difficult to plan well for a three to four-week Sprint during Sprint Planning. This tends to lead to more “dark work”  being done.</li>
                    <li>Related to dark work – new features and needs tend to crop up more often mid-Sprint.</li>
                    <li>The Product Owner will have a harder time not asking for change; e.g. new features or stories mid-Sprint.</li>
                    <li>Fewer Sprint Retrospectives lead to fewer explicit opportunities to improve as a Team.</li>
                    <li>Fewer Sprint Reviews give the Product Owner fewer opportunities to improve the product.</li>
                    <li>Greater risk of Sprint Cancellation due to changes in the market or customer expectations.</li>
                    <li>Greater risk of something going wrong that makes it impractical to deliver the original goal.</li>
                    <li>Makes it easier to do “Mini-Waterfalls” within Scrum, i.e. Analysis -> Development -> Manual Test, with a certain number of days planned for each. This leads to the dark side and Scrum Theatre. Mini-Waterfalls also usually lead to the use of Hardening or Stabilization Sprints.</li>
                    <li>Team and Organizational problems tend to be discovered and addressed more slowly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A longer sprint means less patience for others who need something unplanned from the team. Longer Sprint lengths mean less frequent opportunities for user and stakeholder feedback (Dave Slaten, Kendra West, and Tom Bullock).</li>
            <li>If you were using a different Sprint length and want to change it, consider the following steps  (Dave Slaten, Kendra West, and Tom Bullock).
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: State Your Hypothesis: Why does the team think a two-week Sprint would be better?</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Design Your Experiment: What data should be tracked</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Collect The Data</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Analyze The Results</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Additional Considerations (Dave Slaten, Kendra West, and Tom Bullock):
                <ul>
                    <li>If you double your sprint length, your average velocity should also at least double.</li>
                    <li>The trend in velocity should also be increasing</li>
                    <li>Your planning accuracy should stay the same or get better</li>
                    <li>You can measure this by comparing the “say/do” ratio of completing the specific items in the planned Sprint backlog by the end of the Sprint</li>
                    <li>You can also measure this by comparing the number of blocked or unfinished backlog items. Your interrupt profile should stay the same or get better</li>
                    <li>A longer sprint means less patience for others who need something unplanned from the team. Longer Sprint lengths mean less frequent opportunities for user and stakeholder feedback</li>
                    <li>Less frequent feedback may result in more uncertainty and wasted effort in Sprint deliveries</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reasons for having Longer Sprint Length (Mishkin Berteig) 
                <ul>
                    <li>Each Sprint is, ideally, an independent project – longer Sprints may make it easier to get a potentially shippable product increment truly done every Sprint.</li>
                    <li>“False” Sprints such as “Sprint 0” or “Release Sprints” may feel necessary if your Sprint length is too short – try to avoid the need for false Sprints.</li>
                    <li>Sprints need to be long enough that Sprint Planning, Review and Retrospective can be meaningful. A 1-day Sprint would allow a maximum of 24 minutes for Sprint Planning, 12 minutes for Review and Retrospective each.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
